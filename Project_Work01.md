## Hello Researchers, 
Data Science with Python: Beginner to Advance course
has prepared three types of research interest groups. 
1. Oceanography and Hydrography
2. Climate and Weather 
3. Others
***
After the ending of 50% of the total course, now we 
have the fundamental knowledge of coding and capable of doing:
- *Simple Operations*
- *Using Different Data Types*
- *Variables*
- *Control Structures and Comparisons*
- *Loops*
- *Functions*
- *Modules*
- *Exception Handling*
- *File Open, Read and Write*
- ETC.
***
Now, it's time to step forward and practice if we can solve some research problems of our own. 
***Read the following instructions carefully and the example as well.*** It's not necessary to 
solve the exampled problem, you can also relate the same with your own research (if any).
***
## 1. **Oceanography and Hydrography Group:**

***Problem:*** Suppose, you have some water quality parameter data from different coasts of Bangladesh.
You know some formula of indices and want to make some comparisons of different coasts to find some
interesting result. 

***Hints:***
1. You can use your own data. 
2. You can make your own flowchart. 
3. Categorize the water quality of different areas. 
4. Make sample average data. 
5. You can create new data set from your existing data. 
6. You can take the provided data set for example. 
7. You can consider the provided flowchart for example. 
8. Use Functions and Modules so that the code can be reusable. 
***
## 2. **Climate and Weather Group:**

***Problem:*** From 1972 to 2020, find the windspeed data of all cyclones. 
From the data create your workable data, find the highest SLP of each cyclone, 
Highest Windspeed of each cyclone, Calculate the average windspeed and SLP.
categorize all cyclone depending on Wind speed and Find out which cyclone had
the highest windspeed. 

***Hints:***
1. You can use your own data or from any source. 
2. You can make your own flowchart. 
3. Categorize all cyclone. 
4. You can create new data set from your existing data.
5. You can consider the provided flowchart for example.
6. Use Functions and Modules so that the code can be reusable.

## 3. **Others Group:**

***Problem:*** You may have a problem regarding Health Issue, Agriculture, Education, 
Geology, Sediment, Heavy Metals, Spatial Planning, etc. Collect Your Data, Build new data 
from existing data with some formulas, Categorize the dataset. Make the Code as a module 
so that you can use same code for other dataset or research of same types.

***Hints:***
1. You can use your own data or from any source. 
2. You can make your own flowchart. 
3. Categorize your items / data sets
4. Find some results of your interest. 
5. Use Functions and Modules so that the code can be reusable.
